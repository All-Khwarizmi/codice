 * Interval (integer)
 *
 * An integer number indicating the number of days to wait before the next review.
 *
 * Repetitions (integer)
 *
 * The number of times the information has been reviewed as of this review. repetitions should equal zero for the first review.
 *
 * This value is maintained between calls to the algorithm and used for calculating interval. * The number increments after each successful review. SM-2 will reset repetitions to zero if * quality is less than 3.
 *
 * Ease factor
 *
 * A floating point number (â‰¥ 1.3) which is adjusted up or down based on how easily the information was remembered.
 *
 * This value is maintained between calls to the algorithm and is used for calculating interval.
